Welcome to the wiki site of FCKeditor. This site is not intended to replace our [http://www.fckeditor.net official web site], but aims to be the place to find references, technical information and the documentation about the editor.

== Few words about the project ==
FCKeditor is an Open Source (see ["License"]) HTML text editor that brings many of the powerful functionality of known desktop editors like Word to the web.

It's really lightweight and doesn't require any kind of installation on the client computer.
